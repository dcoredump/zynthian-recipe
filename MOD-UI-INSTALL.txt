Installing MOD-UI on a  Raspi (2/3) with Hifiberry
==================================================

This is a compilation of some software for running MOD-UI on a Raspi. You
need a good audio card (Hifiberry) and a USB-MIDI interface for using.

You have to use a preinstalled Raspian-jessie-light. After that you can use
the following scripts in the given order:

- install_mod_zynthian.sh
- install_lv2_lilv.sh
- install_jack2.sh
- install_a2jmidid.sh
- install_mod-host.sh
- install_mod-ui.sh
- install_phantomjs.sh

MOD-UI is a web frontend which make it possible and very intuitive to setup
synths/simulators and effects in the LV2 audio-plugin format. As a backend
MOD-Host is working for organizing and stacking the LV2 plugins.

Most of the used software is written and organized by MOD
(http://moddevices.com/). They sell a very good hardware which also has 
audio inputs and can be used as MIDI- and guitar effect-rack.

Many thanks to the MOD guys for this really nice piece of hardware (ModDuo) and
software! Also many thanks to all LV2 contributors!

For installing additional instruments and effects:
- install_mod-utilities.sh
- install_mod-mda.sh
- install_mod-caps.sh
- install_mod-distortion.sh
- install_mod-setbfree.sh
- install_mod-tap.sh
- install_guitarix.sh
- install_fluidsynth.sh
- install_fluidplug.sh
- install_midifilter.lv2.sh

If you want do have the SDK (for creating GUI elements for LV2 plugins) running
on port 9000 use the following script:
